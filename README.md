Wisp is an iOS app for using Claude Code on [Sprites](https://sprites.dev/) on
mobile.

## Sprites

Sprites are basically a Linux machine that can be created super fast, and
start/stop instantly. They come preinstalled with Claude, a bunch of language
runtimes, and some other useful tools. They're a really great way to run Claude
Code, because they're isolated but Claude can have access to the whole machine.
It has no problem installing more stuff, writing and running arbitrary scripts,
cloning git repos, etc.

### Other cool things about Sprites:

- They're only running when they're doing stuff
- You get a https URL for each sprite, and any server running on port 8080 is
  served on that URL. This is private by default but can be made public. Super
  easy for prototypes, webhooks, etc. Make it a service and it'll be persistent.
- They can take checkpoints and revert quickly, so it's really easy to get back
  to a working state if you (or Claude) breaks something
- Claude has a skill that teaches it to do all of those things

## Why Wisp?

Sprites have an official CLI and API, but no official app. They don't have SSH,
so a normal terminal emulator can't be used to connect to them.

Wisp makes them available through an iOS app, focused on running Claude. This
means we have all the flexibility of Sprites, through a mobile chat UX.

## Features

- List Sprites
- Create a new Sprite
- Chat with Claude on any Sprite
- Make the URL public and open it in Safari
- View checkpoints, create a new one and restore to any checkpoint
- Optional Github auth - if connected then every Sprite is authenticated automatically when created
- Multiple simultaneous chats per Sprite 

## How does Chat work?

Wisp uses the
[Sprite services API](https://sprites.dev/api/sprites/services#create-service)
to run Claude on the Sprite and listen for its response. It calls Claude in
non-interactive mode `-p`, with `--output-format stream-json`. The JSON messages
are received in the streaming response, and displayed in the chat as Claude responds.
When you send a follow up message `--resume` is used to pass the previous
session ID to Claude and continue the chat.

## Enhancements over upstream

This fork ([zmanian/wisp](https://github.com/zmanian/wisp)) adds the following on top of [mcintyre94/wisp](https://github.com/mcintyre94/wisp):

### Thinking shimmer and inline tool steps

Replaces the basic streaming indicator with a richer UX during Claude's tool use:

- **Thinking shimmer** -- a pulsing animation at the bottom of the chat showing the current tool activity (e.g., "Reading file...", "Running command...")
- **Inline tool steps** -- completed tool calls appear as compact rows below the shimmer with tool name, timing, and a checkmark. Tap any step to see the full input/output in a detail sheet.

### Dynamic Island Live Activity

An ActivityKit Live Activity shows Claude's progress in the Dynamic Island and on the Lock Screen, even when the app is backgrounded:

- **Dynamic Island compact** -- colored status dot (blue = active, green = done) and current intent text
- **Dynamic Island expanded** -- sprite name, current tool, step count, and previously completed tool
- **Lock Screen banner** -- sprite name with step count pill, stacked intent cards with depth effect, current tool with a live timer, and a completion state with green checkmark
- Automatic lifecycle management tied to the chat streaming flow

### Stream reliability

- Reduced HTTP stream idle timeout from 1 hour to 2 minutes so silently dropped connections trigger auto-reconnect instead of hanging indefinitely
- Service event decode failures are logged instead of silently dropped
